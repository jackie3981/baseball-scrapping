# Baseball Statistics Dashboard

## üåê Live Demo

**Live Dashboard:** [https://baseball-scrapping-qwpctcbmwyu52usfxkkevp.streamlit.app](https://baseball-scrapping-qwpctcbmwyu52usfxkkevp.streamlit.app)

A Web scraping and data visualization project that collects, processes, and displays historical baseball statistics from 1876 to 2025, covering American League (AL), National League (NL), and Minor Leagues.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline from web scraping to interactive visualization:

1. **Web Scraping**: Automated data collection using Selenium
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processing and normalizing raw CSV files
3. **Database Management**: SQLite database with optimized queries
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based web application for data exploration

## Features

### Overview Tab

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser (for Selenium)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackie3981/baseball-scrapping.git
cd baseball-scrapping
```

2. **Create virtual environment** (On Windows)
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Verify database exists**
The `baseball_stats.db` file should be in the root directory (~3.28 MB). If not, run the migration:
```bash
python migrate_to_db.py
```

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

The dashboard will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Data Pipeline

### 1. Web Scraping
```bash
# Scrape American League data
python scraper_al.py

# Scrape National League data
python scraper_nl.py

# Scrape Minor Leagues data
python scraper_minor.py
```

**Features:**
- Selenium-based automated scraping
- Checkpoint system for resumable scraping
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Error handling and logging

### 2. Data Cleaning
```bash
# Clean all CSV files
python data_cleaner.py

# Analyze data quality
python analyze_data.py

# Fix specific data issues (if needed)
python fix_data.py
```

**Cleaning process:**
- Remove special characters and placeholders
- Standardize decimal formats
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Generate before/after reports

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
# Create SQLite database from cleaned CSVs
python migrate_to_db.py
```

**Database features:**
- 34 tables with optimized indexes
- 14,071 total rows
- Data type enforcement (INTEGER, REAL, TEXT)
- NULL value validation

### 4. Query Interface (Optional)
```bash
# Interactive command-line queries
python query_database.py
```

## Database Schema

## Data Sources

All data scraped from [Baseball Almanac](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/):
- Team standings and records
- Individual player statistics
- League leaders by category
- Historical data from 1876 to 2025

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **Selenium**: Web scraping automation
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database
- **Streamlit**: Interactive dashboard framework
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualizations

## Code Quality
- **Modular Design**: Separate scripts for scraping, cleaning, and visualization
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with informative error messages
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for all operations
- **Caching**: Streamlit caching for improved performance
- **Validation**: Data quality checks at every stage
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and docstrings

### Testing
- CSV validation reports
- Data quality analysis
- Database integrity checks
- Migration verification

## Known Limitations

1. **Complete Statistics**: Full team statistics (hitting/pitching) only available for 2002-2004
2. **Minor Leagues**: Limited to four historical leagues (AA, FL, PL, UA)
3. **Real-time Updates**: Data is static, requires manual scraping for updates

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add playoff and World Series data
- [ ] Include player biographical information
- [ ] Add export functionality (PDF reports, CSV downloads)
- [ ] Add more advanced statistics (WAR, OPS+, ERA+)
